## ⚡ Optimizations Implemented  

✅ **Reduced Database Storage by ~90%**  
- Initially, images were stored as **Base64 strings**, which are huge (hundreds of KB → MB).  
- Optimized by uploading to **Cloudinary** and saving only the **secure_url**.  
- This made the DB lighter, faster, and more scalable.  

✅ **Improved Performance via CDN**  
- Images are delivered through **Cloudinary’s global CDN**, ensuring **faster load times worldwide**.  
- Supports on-the-fly **image optimization, compression, and resizing**.  

✅ **Efficient File Handling**  
- Used **Multer** for uploads and automatically deleted temp files with `fs.unlink`.  
- Prevents server storage from filling up with unused files.  

✅ **Optimized Resume Handling**  
- Instead of storing large PDFs, only **parsed text + AI feedback** are stored in DB.  
- Reduces DB load while still retaining all useful resume insights.  

✅ **Scalable Real-time Likes System**  
- Designed **concurrent-safe like/unlike updates** so multiple users can interact simultaneously.  
- Provides instant, conflict-free UI updates.  

✅ **Role-based Usage Limits**  
- Free users → restricted API calls to avoid abuse.  
- Premium users → unlimited access to AI features.  
- Ensures controlled resource usage while offering a real SaaS-like experience.
